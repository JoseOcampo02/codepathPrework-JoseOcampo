2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
 One challenge that I encountered what trying to solve problems that I encountered in these new languages. I have worked almost exclusively with java with only a little but of python. HTML and Javascript were completely foreign to me, and this became evident to me one I started trying to problem solve in my project.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I have multiple question about how to implement certain features into my project. For example, how can I nest SetInterval with SetTimeout without issues of scoping and anonymous fuction calls. I tried to decalre the setInterval function a a global variable, but the counter would start and end when it wasnt supposed to.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If i had a few more hours I would have worked on debugging my timer. Additionally, there are any quality of life features that I would have loved to straighten out. For example, stopping the playback of the clues would sometimes cause the colors to remain darkened, and would only return back to normal when the computer happend to play the clue back in another iteration of the game.
